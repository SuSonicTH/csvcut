## additional features
* option to filter the last x lines (trailer), maybe as part of index filter with negative sign (i.e. --filterLine -1,-2 filters last 2 lines)
* add --sum option to sum up numeric columns (i.e. --sum 2,3 would output the unique values of the 1st column and the sums of column 2 and 3)
